# Tech Blog

## Description
This project uses several different features to publish a tech blog, where users can log in and add blog posts, comments, delete existing blog posts, and logout. This application uses Handlebars, MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, and express.js.

## Installation
In order to run this website, ensure that "npm i" has been run in the terminal. Next you will need to seed the database by running "npm run seed". Finally run "node server.js" in the terminal to begin listening on localhost:3001. Once it confirms that it is listening and the database is seeded, you can access via http://localhost:3001/.

## Credits
To work on this assignment, I used the class mini-challenge as a reference to get started. I also consulted past class examples and activities, re-watched class videos and took some suggestions that were provided by my instructor.
